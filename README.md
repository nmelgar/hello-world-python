# Overview

In this project, I created a simple "Hello World!" program using Python to enhance my programming skills and solidify my understanding of basic programming concepts. Writing a "Hello World!" program is a traditional first step for software engineers when learning a new language or setting up a development environment. It provides an excellent opportunity to ensure that everything is working correctly and that I can run and execute code successfully.

The purpose of this program was to establish a foundational step in my journey as a software engineer, ensuring I could successfully write, execute, and understand Python code. This project also allowed me to configure GitHub and familiarize myself with Markdown documentation practices.
